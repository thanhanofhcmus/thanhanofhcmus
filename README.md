### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to write good **react** and **vue** with **typescript**, as well as managing backend with **couchdb**, **mongodb**.
- How to reach me:
  + My [personal email](mailto:thanhanofhcmus.gmail.com).
  + My [school email](mailto:19120161@student.hcmus.edu.vn).
- Fun facts about me:
  + I prefer _strongly typed languge_, as well as more a _functional_ appoach to a problem than _OO_. So i really like **cpp**, **rust**, **typescipt**, **haskell**.
  + I think the _typescipt_ type system when you put type rules to something originally not meant to be typed is quite as fascinating.
  + I starts with _C++_ and got quite sufficent at it, I've even try to rewrote the _Standard Template Library (STL)_! (although not much of a success).
  + I am a _Linux_ enthusiast and cannot live without _VIM_ keymap.
